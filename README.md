MVP of social application to meet individuals with similar interests. 

## Application Description

This application allowed users to check into an establishment and list a few of their interests. Those checked into the same establishment would appear on a list with a usename and the listed interests. They would then invite somebody to chat with and the invitee would receive a notification that someone wishes to meet them. The invitee would then be presented with a collection of profile pictures that they would approve of or disapprove of. If the profile picture of the user who invited was approved, then the chat would be initiated. Otherwise the process would end there. If approved, they could find the other user in the establishment simply through the app with the chat feature or by looking for the person in the place with the profile picture.
